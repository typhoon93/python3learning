This repository contains some python code that I have written while learning. Timelines here are generally correct, so you can look at the time the file added to see when it was done.

This doesn't even scratch the surface of the code I have written, but I do not have an open source project at least at this time to share. If I have mentioned some project in a job application, when we get to a face to face interview phase, I can show you my code and demonstrate functionalities.

Per request, I can also give you access to some quick videos where I demo the projects / explain the code used in the below projects:

**Elephant Tree Game** - code is available in this repo, described below.

**Goals & Aspirations Project** - Uses DJANGO. personal project that I use to keep track of goals and stay focused. Not open source. Inspired by the PCC book.

**Pong Game** - created during 100 days of code course. Demonstrates OOP.

**Snake Game** - created during 100 days of code course. Demonstrates OOP.

**Description of files & folders here:**

**data-structures-and-algorithms** - theory where I learned about the data structure or algo + problems subfolders for each where I solve LC exercises related to the data structure.
**books** - books which I have read related to python and some lessons from them, for my own reference.
**mmLogoSolution.py** - a script that was created to solve a homework assignment i got for a job application.



**blackjack-project** - this hold code to a blackjack game. I do not remember the name of the course that this was done in.


**ticTacToe_project.py** - this is a tictactoe game. If I am not mistaken, done during the same course as blackjack-project.


**elephant-tree-game** - this is a full game, inspired by projects thought in Python Crash Course book. 


# Commit Flow:

1. If new lesson or course -> create a branch for it. Name example: "books/fluent_python"
2. Commit all new stuff there until you are done (regularly push to github.)
3. When finished with the course -> PR or just merge it locally. To keep things clean do a squash merge unless for some reason keeping exact history makes sense in the context.
4. Delete the branch to keep everything clean.
5.
