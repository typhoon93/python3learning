#Why this book?
My hope is that I will get a deep understanding of python after going through it, and have reliable reference material if I want to implement something.
One thing I am currently lacking is an environment where I can learn and get advice from senior practicioners of the language, and I decided to fill in the gap using this book.

Other than that, I hope to be a more well rounded programmer after going through it, and gain a deep level of python expertise. I believe right now is the best time for such a  book for me.

#Sections & Reviews:

##Preface
This one immediately sends me to the official python documentation as a prerequisite for the book. I will go thorugh it just in case it has something I do not know yet, since I have never actually read the whole thing in one go.
