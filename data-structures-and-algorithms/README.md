This folder holds data & code concerning my Data Structures & Algorithms journey.

My flow is this:

1. Go thorugh a course. The course I studies from is called Python Data Structures & Algorithms - LINK: https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/

I had an older rendition of the course, so I did not study HEAPS from this course. At the time of writing this, I am still to go through the theory & details of heaps.

My general approach to the theory was that I tried to always write the implementations of the different functions myself first, and then looked at the course code, so that is why most of the time we will have 2 files or two functions for each method. 

2. Solve LeetCode problems regarding each Data Structure. The course does not have theory about simpe LISTS or HEAPS. Lists I am already very familiar with because of my work with python, but I will be solving LeetCode exercises for it anyway. I will have a systematic approach to the problems. I have already gone through the theory at time of writing this, so I will only be solving actual problems. I will solve:

10 easy problems.
10 medium problems.
3 hard problems.

for each data structure. The algo is:

Solve 3 easy problems for each. Then solve 7 easy problems for each . 
Solve 3 medium problems for each. Then solve 7 medium problems for each.
Solve 3 hard problems for each

I might not be super strict about the pattern, and some of the data structures do not have that many problems per categoy anyway, but the goal is to have a good grasp of each structure, and gradually increase the complexity. 

Reason for going through this:
Become a better programmer, have a deeper understanding of Python. Have an intuitive grasp of the available data structures, so I can use them as assets and building blocks easily for future problems. Understand code optimization and notation, so I can solve and communicate about solutions to problems requiring it effectively.
