Description
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.
You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.
Return the answer with the smaller index first.
Example 1:
Input:
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10
Output: [0,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

Output: [0,1]
 You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
